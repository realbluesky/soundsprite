### What?

**Forked from [tonistiigi/audiosprite] (https://github.com/tonistiigi/audiosprite) to target other frameworks - all credit to original author**

This is a `ffmpeg` wrapper that will take in **multiple audio files** and combines them **into a single file**.  The final file will be exported in `mp3`, `webm`, `opus`, `m4a` and `caf`(IMA-ADPCM) to support as many devices as possible. This tool will also generate a `JSON` file that is compatible with [goldfire/howler.js](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js) framework.

This project is also targeting [bp74/StageXL] (https://github.com/bp74/StageXL) - implementation pending.

### Why?

iOS, Windows Phone and some Android phones have very limited HTML5 audio support. They only support playing single file at a time and loading in new files requires user interaction and has a big latency. To overcome this there is a technique to combine all audio into single file and only play/loop certain parts of that file. [goldfire/howler.js](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js) is a audio framework that uses this technique. 

###Installation

```
npm install -g soundsprite
```

#### Hints for Windows users

- You need to install [Node.js](https://www.nodejs.org/)
- Use [Git Bash](http://git-scm.com/download/win) instead of Command Line or Powershell
- Download [ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/) and include it in your path `export PATH=$PATH:path/to/ffmpeg/bin`
- IMA-ADPCM(the fastest iPhone format) will only be generated if you are using OSX.

####Custom silent track

On some cases starting and pausing a file has bigger latency than just setting playhead position. You may get better results if your file is always playing. `--silence <duration>` option will generate extra track named *silence* that you can play instead of pausing the file.

####Usage with [goldfire/howler.js](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js) framework.

Generated JSON file can be passed straight into `Howl` constructor. Check out [Howler.js documentation] (http://goldfirestudios.com/blog/104/howler.js-Modern-Web-Audio-Javascript-Library) for more info.

```javascript
var settings = /* JSON generated by audiosprite*/;
var sound = new Howl(settings);
```
